                        Perform a comprehensive code review with the following focus areas:

            1. **Code Quality**
               - Clean code principles and best practices
               - Proper error handling and edge cases
               - Code readability and maintainability
               - Focus on using an incremental and flexible architecture
               - Focus on reusability
               - Strengthen the approach towards increasing the Domain Driven-Design nature of the project architecture

            2. **Security**
               - Check for potential security vulnerabilities
               - Validate input sanitization
               - Review authentication/authorization logic

            3. **Performance**
               - Identify potential performance bottlenecks
               - Review database queries for efficiency
               - Check for memory leaks or resource issues

            4. **Testing**
               - Verify adequate test coverage
               - Review test quality and edge cases
               - Check for missing test scenarios

            5. **Documentation**
               - Ensure code is properly documented
               - Verify README updates for new features
               - Check API documentation accuracy

            Provide detailed feedback using inline comments for specific issues.
            Use top-level comments for general observations or praise.

            Always have only one review per PR. If a review from you already exist, update the existing one instead of creating a new review each time a new commit is added to the PR.

            The PR reviews for this project must ALWAYS be in Spanish.
